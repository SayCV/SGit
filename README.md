Quick start
-----------
### To clone a remote repository:
1. Click on the *+* icon to add a new repository.
2. Enter remote URL (see URL format below)
3. Enter local repo name - note that this is not a path since sGit stores all repos in the same directory on the mobile device.
4. Username - username to use for remote repo.
5. Password - password for remote repo.
6. Click the *Clone* button.
7. If all the credentials are correct, sGit will download the repo (all branches) to your device.

### To create a local repository:
1. Click on the *+* icon to add a new repository.
2. Click on "Init Local" to create a local repository.
3. Enter the name for this repository when prompted.
4. A local repo will be created.

### URL format
#### SSH URLs
* SSH running on standard port (22): `ssh://username@server_name/path/to/repo`
* SSH running on non-standard port: `ssh://username@server_name:port/path/to/repo`
* `username` is needed - by default, sGit tries to connect as root!

#### HTTP(S) URLs
* HTTPS URL: https://server_name/path/to/repo
